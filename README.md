# Bluesky MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@brianellin/bsky-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/@brianellin/bsky-mcp-server)

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and provides tools to interact with the ATProtocol.

You can use this MCP server to bring context from various Bluesky / ATProtocol API endpoints directly into the context window of your LLM based application. For example, you can add this server to Claude Desktop and then use it as a natural language Bluesky client. 

## Features & Tools

- Interact with common Bluesky features via natural language (e.g. "Get recent posts from David Roberts")
- Fetch and analyze feeds ("Find me a feed about Seattle and tell me what people are talking about")
- Fetch and analyze lists of followers ("What types of accounts does Mark Cuban follow? Give me a detailed report")
- Use an LLM to write a post and then post it for you ðŸ˜± ("Write a haiku about today's weather in my area and post it to bluesky")
- Search for feeds, posts, and people ("Find posts about the #teslatakedown and give me a summary of recent events")
- Analyze who follows you? ("Who follows me on Bluesky? Give me a report")

Here's the current list of tools provided:
